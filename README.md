## My Goal
The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter.

## What I Created
I made a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator">Ruben Vaalt</a>. It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
